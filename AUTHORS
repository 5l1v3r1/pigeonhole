This package is built for and partly based on the Dovecot Secure IMAP server 
written by:

Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>. 

The LDA Sieve plugin is partly based on the original CMUSieve plugin for the
Dovecot secure IMAP server. It is based only on code relating to interfacing t
he CMU Sieve implementation to Dovecot, meaning that no CMU code is
incorporated in this implementation. 

The ManageSieve service is a modified version of Dovecot's IMAP service 
implementation.
