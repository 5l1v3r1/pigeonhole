Vacation Extension
==================

The vacation extension is available by default. In contrast, the (draft)
vacation-seconds extension - which implies the vacation extension when 
used - is not available by default and needs to be enabled explicitly by
adding it to the sieve_extensions setting. The configuration also needs
to be adjusted accordingly to allow a non-reply period of less than a 
day.  

The vacation and vacation-seconds extensions have their own specific
settings. The settings that specify a period (currently all of them) 
are specified in s(econds), unless followed by a d(ay), h(our) or m(inute)
specifier character. 

The following settings can be configured for using the vacation extension:

sieve_vacation_min_period = 1d
  This specifies the minimum period that can be specified for the :days
  and :seconds tags of the vacation command. A minimum of 0 indicates that
  users are allowed to make the Sieve interpreter send a vacation response
  message for every incoming message that meets the other criteria (not
  recommended). 

sieve_vacation_max_period = 0
  This specifies the minimum period that can be specified for the :days tag
  of the vacation command. The configured value must be larger than the
  sieve_vacation_min_period setting. A value of 0 has a special meaning: it
  indicates that there is no upper limit. 

sieve_vacation_default_period = 7d
  This specifies the default period that is used when no :days or :seconds
  tag is specified. The configured value must lie between the
  sieve_vacation_min_period and sieve_vacation_max_period.

Invalid values for the settings above will make the Sieve interpreter log
a warning and revert to the default values. 

Example
=======

plugin {
  # Use vacation-seconds
  sieve_extensions = +vacation-seconds

  # One hour at minimum
  sieve_vacation_min_period = 1h

  # Ten days default
  sieve_vacation_min_period = 10d

  # Thirty days at maximum
  sieve_vacation_max_period = 30d
}
