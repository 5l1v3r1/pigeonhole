Vacation Extension
==================

The vacation extension is available by default. 

The following settings can be configured for using the vacation extension:

sieve_vacation_min_period = 1d
  This specifies the minimum period that can be specified for the :days tag
  of the vacation command. Values are specified in s(econds), unless followed
  by a d(ay), h(our), m(inute) specifier character. 

sieve_vacation_max_period = 0
  This specifies the minimum period that can be specified for the :days tag
  of the vacation command. Values are specified in s(econds), unless followed
  by a d(ay), h(our), m(inute) specifier character. The configured value
  must be larger than the sieve_vacation_min_period setting. A value of 0
  has a special meaning: it indicates that there is no upper limit. 

Example
=======

plugin {
  # ... other plugin settings

  # One minute at minimum
  sieve_vacation_min_period = 1m

  # Thirty days at maximum
  sieve_vacation_max_period = 30d
}
