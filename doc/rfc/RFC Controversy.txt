RFC Controversy
---------------

This file lists all matters that I found to be unclear in their respective RFC
specifications. When the conpliance review finishes the contents of this file 
will be offered to the RFC editors to obtain clarification. Current handling of 
these issues by my implementation is displayed inside [ ... ].

* RFC 5228 (Sieve) : 5.1.  Test address
  "Implementations MUST restrict the address test to headers that
   contain addresses, but MUST include at least From, To, Cc, Bcc,
   Sender, Resent-From, and Resent-To, and it SHOULD include any other
   header that utilizes an "address-list" structured header body."
   
  - Will this cause a fatal script validation error, or are the disallowed 
    headers simply ignored? [fatal validation error]
  - Given the variables extension, sometimes the header names aren't known until
    runtime. If previous answer was to cause a fatal error, will this abort the
    script? [not checked (FIXME); will first be: ignore header]
    
* RFC 5228 (Sieve) : 5.4.  Test envelope
	"The "envelope" test is true if the specified part of the [SMTP] (or
   equivalent) envelope matches the specified key.  This specification
   defines the interpretation of the (case insensitive) "from" and "to"
   envelope-parts.  Additional envelope-parts may be defined by other
   extensions; implementations SHOULD consider unknown envelope parts an
   error."
   
	- Are envelope parts required to be addresses? And if not, what becomes the 
	  meaning of the ADDRESS-PART modifiers? [not handled (FIXME); will first be: 
	  if none specified full string match and trigger validation error otherwise]
