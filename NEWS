v0.1.1 14-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Re-enabled support for compiling against dovecot headers. Much like 
	  cmusieve, command line tools like sievec and sieved are not compiled in this 
	  case.
	* Started implementation of enotify extension. Not anywhere near finished
	  though. 
	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot on various occasions, making this release
	  dependent on Dovecot >= v1.2.alpa4.

	+ Improved logging of errors at specific occasions and added debug messages to
	  find script execution problems quicker. 
	+ Removed code duplication between command line tools and the test suite. 
	  Also restructured the sources of the tools.
	+ Added UTF-8 to UTF-7 folder name conversion for compatibility with IMAP.
	+ Created man pages for the command line tools. These are automatically 
	  installed upon 'make install'
	+ Incorporated Valgrind support into the testsuite and fixed a few memory
	  leaks in the process.
	- Fixed compile error surfacing for gcc3.4. Forgot mask argument for the 
	  open() system call when the O_CREAT flag is specified. Bug found by 
	  Sergey Ivanov.
	- Fixed bug in the sievec tool. -d output was always written to stdout.
	- Fixed important bug in the imap4flags extension. When no :flags argument is 
	  specified, the previous version would always use the final value of the
	  internal variable to set the flags. This means that modifications to the 
	  internal variable also affected the bare fileinto/keep actions executed 
	  earlier. This does not comply to the RFC. 
	- Fixed bug in the include extension's import/export commands. Duplicate
	  import/exports caused problems.
	- Fixed bug in the handling of non-existent scripts. Errors were sometimes 
	  ignored. 
	- Dovecot omitted unfolding multi-line headers. This was added to the cmusieve
	  plugin after the code was incorporated into the new implementation. This is
	  now mplicitly fixed by concurrent change in Dovecot.
