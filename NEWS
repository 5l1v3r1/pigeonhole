v0.1.1 14-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Re-enabled support for compiling against dovecot headers. Much like 
	  cmusieve, command line tools like sievec and sieved are not compiled in this 
	  case.

	+ Improved logging of errors at specific occasions and added debug messages to
	  find script execution problems quicker. 
	+ Removed code duplication between command line tools and the test suite. 
	  Also restructured the sources of the tools.
	+ Added UTF-8 to UTF-7 folder name conversion for compatibility with IMAP.
	+ Created man pages for the command line tools. These are automatically 
	  installed upon 'make install' 
	- Fixed compile error surfacing for gcc3.4. Forgot mask argument for the 
	  open() system call when the O_CREAT flag is specified. Bug found by 
	  Sergey Ivanov.
	- Fixed bug in the sievec tool. -d output was always written to stdout.
	- Fixed important bug in the imap4flags extension. When no :flags argument is 
	  specified, the previous version would always use the final value of the
	  internal variable to set the flags. This means that modifications to the 
	  internal variable also affected the bare fileinto/keep actions executed 
	  earlier. This does not comply to the RFC.
