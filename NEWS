v0.1.4 xx-3-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>
	* Started work on the sieve-filter tool. With this command lin tool it will be 
	  possible to (re-)apply Sieve filters on a mail folder.
	+ Added custom debug extension that adds the possibility to print debug 
	  messages from the Sieve tools.
	- Fixed issue with opening relative paths as a mail file. Bug reported by Ian
	  P. Christian.
	- Fixed MAC OSX compile problem. Turns out the extern modifier was missing at
	  multiple places. Bug reported by Edgar Fuss.
	- Fixed Solaris compile problem: removed unecessary and unportable linker flags 
	  that caused compile to fail. Bug reported by Andr√©s Yacopino.
	

v0.1.3 12-2-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot, making this release dependent on Dovecot
	  >= 1.2.beta1
	* Made mail address comparison fully case-insensitive. This is particularly
	  noticeable for the :addresses argument of the vacation command. 
	+ Finished enotify extension. Currently, only the mailto notification method
	  is implemented. All still needs to be tested thoroughly.
	+ Implemented multiscript support. It is now possible to execute multiple
	  Sieve scripts sequentially. Administrator-controlled scripts can be
	  executed before and after the user's script. Still needs to be tested
	  thoroughly.
	+ Implemented support for configuring the available Sieve extensions.
	+ Made the subaddress extension (partially) configurable using the
	  sieve_subaddress_sep setting, which allows specifying a (multi-charater)
	  separator other than '+'.
	+ Compiler now warns about invalid header field names used for the header and
	  address tests.
	+ Vacation extension now properly generates a References header for the 
	  response message.
	+ Added testing of basic result execution to the test suite. Also added support
	  for testing the outgoing messages produced by the Sieve interpreter. 
	+ Included execution of the actual result in the sieve-test command line tool.
	  The undocumented sieve-exec tool that existed for this is now removed as 
	  planned.
	+ Added support for the now obsolete 'imapflags' extension for backwards
	  compatibility with CMUSieve. This also implements the mark/unmark commands.
	- Fixed bugs in the regex extension: 1) if an optional match value did not in 
	  fact match, subsequent match values would get unexpected indexes. 2) fixed
	  segfault bug occuring when regex is freed.
	- Fixed bug in the use of the :from agrument for the vacation command. If this
	  address included a phrase part, the response would not be a valid RFC822
	  message.
	- Plugged a theoretical security hole occuring when a directory is opened as a 
	  Sieve binary.
	- Cleaned up and fixed various log messages.
	- Fixed bug in the outgoing address verification. Addresses ending in ',' were 
	  erroneously accepted.

v0.1.2 26-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed important bug in the redirect action (and probably other actions like
	  reject and vacation that only send messages). This was a bug in the handling
	  of context information during the execution of actions. It caused the sieve 
	  interpreter to crash with a segfault when redirect was executed. 

v0.1.1 24-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Re-enabled support for compiling against dovecot headers. Much like 
	  cmusieve, command line tools like sievec and sieved are not compiled in this 
	  case.
	* Started implementation of enotify extension. Not anywhere near finished
	  though. 
	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot on various occasions, making this release
	  dependent on Dovecot >= v1.2.alpa4.

	+ Improved logging of errors at specific occasions and added debug messages to
	  find script execution problems quicker. 
	+ Removed code duplication between command line tools and the test suite. 
	  Also restructured the sources of the tools.
	+ Added UTF-8 to UTF-7 folder name conversion for compatibility with IMAP.
	+ Created man pages for the command line tools. These are automatically 
	  installed upon 'make install'
	+ Incorporated Valgrind support into the testsuite and fixed a few memory
	  leaks in the process.
	- Fixed compile error surfacing for gcc3.4. Forgot mask argument for the 
	  open() system call when the O_CREAT flag is specified. Bug found by 
	  Sergey Ivanov.
	- Fixed bug in the sievec tool. -d output was always written to stdout.
	- Fixed important bug in the imap4flags extension. When no :flags argument is 
	  specified, the previous version would always use the final value of the
	  internal variable to set the flags. This means that modifications to the 
	  internal variable also affected the bare fileinto/keep actions executed 
	  earlier. This does not comply to the RFC. 
	- Fixed bug in the include extension's import/export commands. Duplicate
	  import/exports caused problems.
	- Fixed bug in the handling of non-existent scripts. Errors were sometimes 
	  ignored. 
	- Dovecot omitted unfolding multi-line headers. This was added to the cmusieve
	  plugin after the code was incorporated into the new implementation. This is
	  now mplicitly fixed by concurrent change in Dovecot. 

v0.1.0 23-10-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Initial release
