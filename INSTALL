Compiling
---------

First of all you'll need to have pre-built Dovecot 1.2 sources available. It's 
also not a good idea to build the plugin against self-compiled Dovecot sources, 
but then actually use a prebuilt binary package of Dovecot. That might work if 
the Dovecot versions are the same, but it's not guaranteed. You can also use 
installed Dovecot headers to compile this package, but then command line tools 
like sievec and sieved will not be compiled. This is also true for the test 
suite. 

This package is compiled and configured as follows:

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-1.2
make
sudo make install

The --with-dovecot parameter points to your Dovecot sources or, in case you are 
compiling against the headers, to the directory where the dovecot-config file is 
installed.

If you downloaded this package through Mercurial, you need to execute 
./autogen.sh first to build the automake/autoconf structure. This requires
autotools and libtool to be installed. 

Configuring
-----------

Currently identical to cmusieve module. The name of the module is 'sieve', 
however, and not 'cmusieve'. For a detailed description on installing the 
cmusieve plugin for deliver refer to the dovecot wiki:

Test Suite
----------

This package includes a test suite to verify the basic processing of the Sieve
interpreter on your particular platform. Note that the test suite is not 
available when this package is compiled against the Dovecot headers. The test 
suite executes a list of test cases and halts when one of them fails. If it 
executes all test cases successfully, the test suite finishes. You can execute 
the test suite using `make test`.
