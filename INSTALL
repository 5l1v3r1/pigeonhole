Compiling
---------

First of all you'll need to have built Dovecot sources available. It's also
not a good idea to build the plugin against self-compiled Dovecot sources,
but then actually use a prebuilt binary package of Dovecot. That might work
if the Dovecot versions are the same, but it's not guaranteed.

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-1.0
make
sudo make install

Configuring
-----------

Currently identical to cmusieve module. The name of the module is 'sieve', 
however, and not 'cmusieve'. For a detailed description on installing the 
cmusieve plugin for deliver refer to the dovecot wiki:
